<h2>Lazy note to self and any other nerds who visit this website:</h2>
<p>These kinds of webpages don't always work because in the pages' Javascript, it can reference an HTTP protocol link. While that's not *necessarily* an issue,
modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox will block what Mozilla refers to as "mixed content websites." In practice, that means browsers will block any 
information that is fetched *from* a website using the http protocol *to* a website that uses the https protocol as a security measure. In layman's terms, it 
breaks the website in annoying ways. I'm leaving this here not just because I thought it was interesting but because I wanted to help myself remember that 
browsers don't like mixed content websites. It took me awhile to figure out why my project worked on my desktop but not on Github. Live and learn.</p>
