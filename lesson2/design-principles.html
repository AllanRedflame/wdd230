                <p>The "How Strong Is My Password?" tool on Security.org makes good use of Fitt's Law.
                    A very simple way to streamline the experience on your webpage is to make the 
                    primary tool on your website large and obvious. This is extremely useful when 
                    a particular webpage is simple and not very complicated.

                <p> Fastmail.com is an excellent example of using Hick's Law to make their webpage 
                    more friendly for first-time users. There is only a single option on the main 
                    body of the webpage: a "Try for free" button. This is very useful for 
                    companies like fastmail who want to encourage their web traffic to sign up
                    for their service.

                <p>Google's Pixel website makes frequent usage of the rule of thirds at the top of their
                    webpages. They accomplish this by positioning the subject in the left or right 
                    third of the image's layout. This is especially important for a sales website which
                    needs to display the product clearly and in a visually interesting way.
